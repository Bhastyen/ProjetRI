Enation is an 








American







 
independent rock 
band formed in 

Battle Ground, Washington
 








United States







 in 
2002.



 History 



Brothers and 
Hollywood actors 

Jonathan Jackson
 and Richard Lee Jackson, who have been acting in film and television for over 14 years alongside some of the biggest names in entertainment such as 
Al Pacino, 


Robin Williams

, 

Michelle Pfeiffer
, 
Jim Caviezel, 


Calista Flockhart

 and 


Ben Kingsley

, formed the music group that came to be known as Enation after Jonathan and Richard has been playing together for years and invited their good friends Daniel Sweatt and Michael Galeotti to join.


 Ride,  Enation's first single from their 2004 debut independent album, Identity Theft, was featured prominently as the theme song to 

Riding the Bullet
, a 



Stephen King


 thriller which also stars the band's frontman, Jonathan Jackson.


The band later released two independent albums in 2007, Soul   Story: Volume One and Where the Fire Starts. Both of which are available for purchase on the band's website and on 








CD Baby







, the nation's leading seller of independent rock.


On 
December 31, 
2005, Enation band member Michael Galeotti married film and television actress 

Bethany Joy Galeotti
, who is best known for her portrayal of 



Haley James Scott


 on the television series 

One Tree Hill
. Bethany, an aspiring and somewhat accomplished singer and songwriter herself, later re-recorded Enation's song  

Feel This
  for prominent use in the fifth season finale of One Tree Hill. Interest in the song skyrocketed after the episode had aired and the song later became a top selling song on both CD Baby and 
iTunes, as did the season finale episode itself, being the number one most-purchased episode of television on iTunes the week it premiered. The couple still lives in Battle Ground, Washington, where Enation was formed as a band, while Bethany is not filming One Tree Hill in 

Wilmington, North Carolina
.
